Week 1

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Figure out which projects I would like to work on. 
	• Draft reasons why I should work on them and submit them.

Problems:
Hard to choose which projects I would like to work on.

Progress:
Figured out my preferences and submitted them.

Summary:
Throughout the week I spent most of my time trying to figure out which of the projects appealed to me.  Once I finally figured that out what projects I wanted, I wrote my reasons for why I want to work on the projects and why I would be a good candidate to work on it.  With everything done, I submitted the necessary information.

Week 2

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Figure out what project I will be working on and contact my client and my group to figure out the best lines of communication for the future.  
	• Share this file with my TA, group members, and client.

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
Once I figured out I would be working on the AR Sandbox for my capstone project, the first order of business was to touch bases with my group mates and figure out our lines of communication.  We exchanged phone numbers and created a group text.  After that, we touched base with our client (Joseph) and scheduled a time to meet face to face.  In addition, we decided on a time to meet with our assigned TA Junki.

Week 3

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Meet with Joseph for the first time
	• Establish our GitHub Repo
	• Meet with Junki for the first time
	• Revise Problem Statement

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
After meeting with Joseph for the first time, I gained a longer stronger of an understanding of what this project is going to entail and what work we are going to have to do.  In addition, we met with our TA, Junki for the first time who told us about how he will helpful to us in the future.  We created our GitHub Repo and I put my Problem Statement Rough Draft in it.

Week 4

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Revise Problem Statement
	• Send Problem Statement Joseph for Approval
	• Get approval sent
	• Begin compiling our requirements

Problems:
	1. Joseph has some additions for the problem statement

Progress:
	1. Applied the additions and sent the changes back for approval

Summary:
This week we made several revisions to our Problem Statement and got a draft approved by Joseph.  After a little back and forth, we all came to an agreement.  In addition, we came together and agreed on our plan for next week (including what we should have ready about the requirements document by next class).

Week 5

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:

	• Create a rough draft of the SRS and run it by Joseph to get feedback

Problems:
	1. I tried to access the IEEE document about SRS, but my access was denied.  

Progress:
	1. I tried again on a campus computer, then emailed the document to myself for use off of campus.

Summary:
This week I spent most of my time working on the SRS.  To begin, Andrew, Raja and I met up and discussed what the basic requirements were for the system and jotted them down.  We then read through the IEEE document in order to make sure we were making the document correctly.  We assigned different sections of the document to each other and split off to work on them.  I was assigned the 3rd section of the SRS, the actual requirements.  I compiled the requirements we had discussed into the document after reading through the different organizational structures and picking a combination of the Stimulus and Mode structures.  After that, I filled in as much of the rest of the 3rd section as a could prior to meeting to Joseph to go over what we had written.  We gave us extensive feedback on what we were doing correctly and what we needed to change.  These changes have been recorded and will be applied this weekend.

Week 6

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Revise SRS into final draft
		○ Meet with Joseph about its content

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
This week I was able to spend a lot of time working on the SRS, which proved very fortunate.  In that time, I was able to meet with Andrew and Raja several times, and both Joseph and Kirsten once.  We were able to get a lot done during these meetings and I think the SRS reflects that.  The biggest change that Kirsten mentioned was that we were being too specific in many portions of the document, be venturing into "design" territory.  Once those were taken out, the document flowed a lot better.

Week 7

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Figure out which aspects to research for the Tech Review
	• Begin researching for Tech Review

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:

This week we began work on our tech review.  Raja, Andrew and I met up and discussed which technologies would be best to research for the sandbox and grouped them together as best we could.  We then decided who would research what.  I am in charge of researching the depth sensor, the generation/capture of data, and the projector we will use.  In addition, we met with Junki (as we do weekly) and were told that we received full points for our SRS document.

Week 8

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Do additional work on the tech review based on the feedback from the in class peer review
	• Have the tech review mostly complete

Progress:
	• Did additional research for the Tech review, but still have a decent amount to do

Problems:
	• MECOP fall event is this week, limiting my time to work
	• Physics midterm is this week also limiting my time

Summary:
This week was incredibly chaotic and it resulted in not as much work getting done for this classes I would have liked.  I had both the MECOP fall event as well as the Physics midterm to take which severely limited my time.  I was able to put some time aside to research some more for the tech review (namely the depth sensor section), but I need to work on it a decent amount this weekend.

Week 9

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
Finish the Tech Review
Eat a lot of Thanksgiving turkey

Problems:

Progress:
Completed the Tech Review, unfortunately I turned it in 5 minutes late because I had trouble with my LaTeX compilation.

Summary:
This was a short week, so not a whole lot of work got done.  With that being said, a considerable amount of effort was put in during the first two days in order to turn in the best Tech Review possible using the time I had left.

Week 10

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Create the Design Document
		○ Meet with Joseph to get okay for Document
		○ Check with his opinions on our tech review conclusions
		○ Attend Kirsten's office hours to get feedback on current design progress

Problems:
	
	• None of us really understand what the IEEE SDD document is telling us

Progress:
	• Looked at examples of Design Documents past and got a lot better grasp of what we are supposed to do

Summary:

This week was spent in its entirety to complete the design document.  I spent a lot of time both individually and with the group working on this.  In the beginning, I spent time trying to solidify my understand of what this document was asking of us, but after seeing some example I figured it out.  After that I met with Andrew and Raja several times to layout, work on, and assign sections on the document.  The design document is in a pretty place come the end of this week.  There are some known changes that are going to implemented, but there is not enough time to fully implement those within this week.

\subsubsection{Winter}
\begin{lstlisting}
Week 1

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Touch base with group
	• Establish plan for near future (meeting times and such)

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
Met with group for the first time of the term.  As a result of the meeting, we decided our scheduled meeting times would be 9am on Tuesdays and an online meeting at 5ish on Thursdays.  This will allow for stand-up like meetings to occur regularly to ensure everyone is on the same page.  We also decided meetings with Junki would be from 4:40 - 4:50 on Tuesdays.

Week 2

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Meet with group and setup standup times
	• Meet with Joe and get orders for components in
	• Discuss how the physical sandbox is actually going to be created
	• Begin playing around with unity and getting a feel for how the program works
	

Problems:
	• I became very sick and was not able to work for a couple days
	• Joe still needs to get his funding application approved before we have the funds to get the equipment we need

Progress:

Summary:
This week, Andrew, Raja, and I met several times and discussed consistent meeting times and prepared our Tech Reviews and Design document for final approval by Joe.  We met with Joe on Friday (without me because I was sick), and got some feedback on our design document and started the discussion of ordering the components we require.

Week 3

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Get final approval on Tech Reviews and Design Document
	• Begin work on the interfaces present within our system
	• Begin interfacing with the Kinect

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
This week we got our Tech reviews and Design Document approved by Joe and watched several Unity tutorials to get the ball rolling on creating the interfaces for the project.

Week 4

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Get the Interfaces of the system created in a skeletal form
	• Integrate depth sensor with Andrews mesh

Problems:
	• I have a midterm as well as my MECOP interviews this week so I will be constrained for time
	• Joe decided that he wanted to try using the Intel Realsense instead of Kinect, so we need to wait on the hardware integration until it arrives
	• Our .gitignore files isn't ignoring things properly, making version control very messy

Progress:
	• Midterms and interviews have been completed and am now able to devote more time to the project
	• Worked through .gitignore issues and got the version control a lot more clean

Summary:
This week was a stressful and very busy for me, but I feel we made some pretty good progress.  Once I got through my midterm and my interviews, I was able to start on some project things.  The team met up and we laid out a roadmap of what needed to get worked on and when we want certain pieces of the project done.  I spent a decent amount of time reconfiguring our Unity project in order to allow proper version control with it.

Week 5

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Complete our Alpha release
	• Complete the majority of the poster rough draft
	• Complete a rough outline of our progress report

Problems:
	• The projector that we chose for the project does not have a short enough throw ratio.  As a result, the image is too small and the projector has to be moved unreasonably far in order to get  picture of sufficient size.

Progress:

Summary:
This week, we got pretty close to the Alpha release being completely done.  We only have a few touch-ups to do, but our interfaces are mainly created.  In addition, the majority of the poster was completed in a rough form.  We plan to complete the outline of the progress report this weekend.

Week 6

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Complete the Poster template
	• Complete the progress report
	• Integrate the Kinect into the system
	• Find sufficient Projector replacement

Problems:
	

Progress:

Summary:
During this week, I spent a very large amount of time working on the progress report and poster assignments for this class.  These took a lot of time, but I feel pretty good about their quality.  There were a couple pieces of the poster (conclusions and images) which were simply placeholders at this moment, but they should be filled in in due time.

Week 7

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• We had planned to get  design mode with bezier curves complete this week, but we had not anticipated the work required for the poster and progress report last week when planning, so it might get pushed back slightly

Problems:
	1. Joe will be out of town this Friday for our usual Friday meeting
	2. Without a Kinect plugged into the system, we can't see any form of the terrain mesh

Progress:
	1. We will send out a recap email at the end of the week to keep Joe informed
	2. Create a hardcoded heightmap (like we originally had), that we can enable when working on the system without a Kinect
	

Summary:
This week I felt we got a decent amount of work complete.  Andrew was able to get the hardcoded depth image to show up when there is now Kinect present in the system which will allow me to work on things from my home computer.  In addition, I was able to create altered system behavior based on the display mode which is the first step to having the whole system and its modes link together properly.


Week 8

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Establish draggable frame for calibration mode to decide on projections and depth sensor bounds
	

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
I felt like I was able to get a decent amount of work done on the project this week.  My other classes had a lull in their workload and I was able to devote a lot of additional time to working on the project.  I have the framework for the Calibration window up and just need to make the TerrainMask bounds actually update when the submit button is pressed.  Waiting for Andrew's interface before proceeding their however.

Week 9

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Complete implementation of Calibration Branch
	• Try out system with projector and Kinect to assess bugs
	• Work on adjusting the UI to look nicer
	• Do poster critique with Kirsten
	• Figure out physical sandbox status from Joe

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
This week everything kind of came together.  I was able to complete the Calibration Mode and integrate into the master branch with it.  We did a poster critique session with Kirsten that gave us a lot of useful information about how to improve our poster and made some progress on figuring out when the physical sandbox will be available.  I still haven't been able to test the system with the Kinect and the projector myself, but Andrew has and his description has me confident.  I was unable to attend the meeting this Friday with Joe on account of me being in Portland to see my sister who was in town briefly.  In that meeting, I am told, that we discussed the Cut & Fill information that we will need to calculate and sample for the final mode of the system.  In addition to that system, we still need to make the UI look a little nicer.

Week 10

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Finish up beta of sandbox system
		○ Complete Cut & Fill calculations
		○ Adjust the calibration window to scale terrain as well as mask

Problems:
	• Joe accidentally scheduled our meeting time in conflict with another of this meetings, so we were unable to meet

Progress:

Summary:
This week I didn't do a whole lot for the project.  We met up at the start of the week and went over the tasks to work on.  These were the completion of the Cut & Fill mode and some additional calibration scaling.  Raja said he would work on the C&F and Andrew said he would work on the Calibration.  As a result, I was just on standby most of the time, ready if someone needed me to work on something.  Because our meeting got moved to a time that conflicted with my class time, I was unable to meet with Joe this week as well.  We were able to get Cut & Fill complete, but still have some Calibration work to do.


Week 11

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Do the final progress report
	• Record Beta level functionality video

Problems:
	• 

Progress:

Summary:
I managed to get the progress report complete and filled out the team member evaluations.
We recorded our beta level functionality video and we actually managed to get it to 28 minutes long, which I had doubts about.

3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Implement unit/scale feature to calibration mode
	• Revise Poster
	• Create mass-haul diagram in cut & fill mode

Problems:

3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Get the Sandbox completely assembled
	• Get UI to scale properly
	• Add Scaling units
	• Get Midterm Report presentation complete

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
A lot of time was spent this week working on this project.  The majority of that time was working to get the mounting system for the projector on the box working adequately.  After that, the time was spent filming for the demonstration in the Midterm Progress report and working on the report itself.

Week 6

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Work on UI scaling with terrain mask
	• Double check all aspects of requirements document are checked off

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
This week was mainly spent making sure that we had all of our requirements met before the code freeze.  I added the ability to add and remove road nodes, Andrew added the undo feature, and Raja worked on adding additional columns.

Week 7

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Make sure that we are ready for Expo
		○ Meet with Kirsten in regards to storing the sandbox prior to Expo
	• Do Expo

Problems:
	• Need to figure out how we are storing the sandbox
	• Apparently the Expo people didn't know the dimensions of our sandbox and have moved us outside

Progress:
	• We will be bringing the sandbox over to Dearborn the say before and storing it in the Dearborn basement
	• Luckily we are in an area with tented walls to the light won't be too horrible, but need to add curtains to really see anything.

Summary:
Everything went relatively smooth during expo; the sun made it pretty hard to see, but we managed to put up some black curtains which helped a lot.  The box isn't too bad to move with sand in it, which is a nice bonus.

Week 8

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Decompress after Expo
	• Go to class on Wednesday 
	• Discuss work that still needs to be done

Week 9

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Perform the "handoff" of the project
	• Refactor code and add comments
	• Write out changes to design and requirements document so Joe can officially approve them
	• Outline presentation recording details

Problems:

Progress:

Summary:
We performed the "handoff" with the project, which just involved us meeting with Joe and going how he can get the source code.  We me up and outlined who should do what for final presentation, and scheduled with Joe when we could come in and shoot the live-demo.

Monday, September 25, 2017
3:41 PM

Plans:
	• Complete Final Presentation
	• Finish integrating design and requirement changes into official document to be revised
	• Complete writing of user manuals/documentation

Problems:
	• Tried to meet up to film for the presentation, but there was a scheduling conflict and we were unable to shoot

Progress:
	• We found a different time to meet that worked with everyone

Summary:
The majority of work done this week was on the presentation, as it was due on Friday.
Tuesday was spent trying to record the live-demo section, and Thursday was spent completing that recording.  Friday was then spent doing the power point piece of the presentation and splicing all the clips together for the final video.
